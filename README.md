# Scaffold
A quick dev environment built on node, using gulp.

<h2>Why Scaffold?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Utilizes flex layout</li>
  <li>Uses babel for es6</li>
  <li>LESS ready</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Download or clone the repo</li>
  <li>Install packages: yarn or npm install</li>
  <li>Start: npm start</li>
  <li>Port: http://localhost:3000/</li>
</ul>

> Running npm start will start both nodemon and gulp and is all you need to get started.
> This also will watch for changes in server.js as well as all .less and .js files

<h2>Optimizing Images:</h2>

> Scaffold also comes ready to optimize images. Images that are optimized will be sent to the assets directory.
